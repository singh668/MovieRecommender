# MovieRecommender
Recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms that can suggest “relevant” items to users. They predict future behavior based on past data through a multitude of techniques. Utilizing the principles of iten-based collaborative filtering, I use the KNN clustering algorithm to recommend similar movies to users.
